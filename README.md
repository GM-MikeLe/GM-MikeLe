# ‚ôî Michael Le - The Full-Stack Grandmaster

*Every bug is a puzzle, every feature is a strategic move, and every codebase tells a story.*

Book a session for code reviews, system design, career strategy, or any technical challenge. I solve problems like a grandmaster plays chess‚Äî**strategically, patiently, always focused on the endgame.**

*I think ahead, see patterns, execute flawlessly.*

**Ready to make your move?**

## ‚ôï Strategic Philosophy

> *"In chess, as in development, every piece has its purpose. Every move shapes the game. Every decision echoes through the entire system."*

With **4+ years** developing scalable web applications and AI-powered solutions, I approach each project like a chess player who's studied the patterns‚Äîseeing not just the current position, but the endgame possibilities. From founding my first startup to architecting mission-critical features across international markets, I build solutions that are robust today and scalable tomorrow.

*Currently engineering AI-powered systems at Persona Studios | AWS Developer Associate Certified*
